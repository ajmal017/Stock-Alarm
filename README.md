# Stock-Alarm
# Idea
Many Platforms and Apps offer Alarms for certain Stock price levels, though most apps limit the number of alarms, number of stocks or display loads of advertisement, therefore I thought of building my own Stock Alarm App.
The Backend Server will connect to the IEX Api (https://iextrading.com/developers/docs/#last) with a Websocket and implement the Alarm logic and notifies the User over the app when alarms are triggered.

# Stack 
Backend:
  - NodeJS
    - Express
    - SocketIO
    - IEX Api
    
Frontend:
  - Flutter
